"""CORS middleware for the agent server.

The agent server has two distinct CORS requirements:

1. **Most endpoints** authenticate via the ``X-Session-API-Key`` header.
   Browsers never auto-attach custom headers to cross-origin requests, so
   CORS on these routes is not a security boundary — it only controls
   which other-origin SPAs are *allowed* to call the API from
   ``fetch()``. Operators configure this via ``OH_ALLOW_CORS_ORIGINS``;
   localhost/loopback and ``DOCKER_HOST_ADDR`` are always allowed for
   developer ergonomics (the original purpose of ``LocalhostCORSMiddleware``
   — see OpenHands/OpenHands#4624).

2. **The workspace cookie endpoints** are the one place where CORS is a
   real security boundary, because they handle an ambient credential
   (the ``oh_workspace_session_key`` cookie, ``SameSite=None; Secure;
   Partitioned``). These routes are:

     * ``POST`` / ``DELETE`` ``/api/auth/workspace-session`` — mint/clear
       the cookie
     * ``GET`` ``/api/conversations/{id}/workspace/...`` — workspace
       static files served using the cookie

   These routes accept CORS from any origin with credentials. The actual
   security boundary is enforced elsewhere:

     * Minting still requires ``X-Session-API-Key``, so an arbitrary
       origin cannot mint a cookie it doesn't already have the key for.
     * The cookie is ``Partitioned`` (CHIPS), scoping it to the embedding
       top-level site that minted it — at least on browsers that
       implement CHIPS (Chromium/Edge today; Firefox/Safari coverage
       still in progress).

   Wildcard credentialed CORS uses ``allow_origin_regex=r"https?://.+"``
   instead of ``allow_origins=["*"]``. Two reasons:

     * Starlette's ``CORSMiddleware`` treats the literal ``"*"`` as
       ``allow_all_origins=True`` and then emits the string ``"*"`` on
       actual (non-preflight) responses unless the request already
       carries a ``Cookie`` header — which fails the very first mint
       request that creates the cookie, because browsers reject
       ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`` together with
       ``Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true``. The regex path
       unconditionally echoes the request ``Origin`` back, which is
       what credentialed CORS actually requires.
     * Restricting to ``http(s)://`` schemes excludes the literal
       ``Origin: null`` browsers send for sandboxed iframes
       (``<iframe sandbox>``), ``data:`` / ``blob:`` URL frames, and
       certain redirect chains. None of those are legitimate clients
       of these endpoints, and a null-origin context defeats CHIPS
       partitioning (the cookie's partition key would be ``null``,
       making cross-context behavior browser-dependent).

The single global ``CORSDispatcher`` middleware routes each request to
the appropriate underlying middleware based on the request path, after
stripping any ``root_path`` set via FastAPI (so the dispatch is correct
behind reverse proxies that mount this server under a sub-path).
