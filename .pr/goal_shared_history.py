"""Runnable proof that the ``/goal`` loop writes into the SAME conversation history.

What it does:
  1. Sends a normal "main conversation" message and runs the agent.
  2. Runs a ``/goal`` loop on the *same* ``Conversation`` object.
  3. Prints the single shared event log and checks that the main-conversation
     events are still there, untouched, with the goal's objective / agent work /
     judge-driven followups / completion appended after them.

The point: ``run_goal`` drives the conversation you pass in (it does not fork or
spin up a sidecar), so everything lands in one ``conversation.state.events`` log
under one ``conversation.id``. The agent-server ``EventService.start_goal`` uses
the same mechanism on its single ``_conversation``, so this proves the property
both paths rely on.

Run it two ways:
  # Deterministic, no network (scripted TestLLMs) -- always works, quick check:
  uv run python .pr/goal_shared_history.py

  # Real agent doing real work (creates files, runs pytest) -- opt in explicitly:
  GOAL_DEMO_REAL=1 LLM_API_KEY=sk-... LLM_MODEL=gpt-5.5 \
      uv run python .pr/goal_shared_history.py
